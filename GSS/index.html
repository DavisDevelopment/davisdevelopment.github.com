			<h1 class="main-heading">What is GSS?</h1>
			<p class="description-paragraph">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of GSS is is to bring object-oriented programming paradigms to CSS.  GSS borrows much of it's ideas from
			<a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a>, but seeks to be more radical.  GSS supports variables, much like LESS, and even uses the same syntax
			for them as LESS does, and, like LESS, any CSS is valid GSS.  However, the similarities really stop there syntactically.  The principals are the same,
			but the syntax used for them is a bit different.  GSS supports mixins, through the use of the <span class="keyword">mixin</span> keyword, which can be
			used as shorthand for one or more property definitions.  They can be parametric, allowing them to behave much like functions, or can inherit properties from 
			one or more other mixins.  A GSS user can <span class="keyword">import</span> GSS stylesheets into a stylesheet, allowing him to reference variables and mixins
			declared in the imported file, or you can <span class="keyword">inline</span> your other stylesheets, which just fetches the content of the other file and tosses
			it right into the file that referenced it.  There are also a list of helper functions that one can use, among them are ones like <span class="keyword">url</span>,
			<span class="keyword">rgb</span>, and <span class="keyword">mix</span>.  I don't know about you, but vendor prefixes always annoyed the shit out of me. GSS does
			away with this annoyance.  If you're not sure what vendor prefixes to use, or if you should use any, for a particular property, simply prefix the property name with 
			the "~" symbol (or as I call it, the "squiggly line").  The GSS->CSS compiler will check whether the given property needs to be prefixed, and if so, will insert that
			property into the compiled code <em>with</em> all necessary prefixes, and once without any at all.  Here's a small example of some GSS code.

			<p class="description-paragraph">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another interesting feature of GSS is <strong>nested pseudo-classes</strong>, which allows you to nest pseudo-class
				style groups, via the <span class="keyword">when</span> keyword.  For example, to make an H1 tag look click-able, you would use:
				<code class="gss-example" id="when-example2">
body h1.clickme {
	color: #666666;
	when hovered {
		color: black;
		cursor: pointer;
	}
}
				</code><button class="example-runner" for="#when-example2">Compile</button><br><br>
				Or, a more in-depth example where you have a div with a span inside, used to make nicer-looking buttons:
				<div class="fanceh-button"><span>Like This One</span></div>
				<br>
				<code id="when-example3" class="gss-example">
div.fanceh-button {
	display: inline;
	background: #DEDEDE;
	border: solid #565656 1px;
	border-radius: 2px;
	padding: 5px;
	
	span {
		font-weight: bold;
		color: #666666;
	}
	when hovered {
		background: #EFEFEF;
		border: solid black 1px;
		cursor: pointer;
		
		span {
			color: #222222;
		}
	}
	when active {
		background: white;
	}
}

				Now, GSS is still in the alpha phase of it's development, and I wouldn't recommend using it for production, but if you'd like to get a copy of 
				the compiler, there are a number of ways you can go about doing that.  If you'd like to use the NodeJS module, and you already have Node installed,
				you can simply open up your console, and type
				<br>
				npm install gss2css
				<br>
				into it.  A Python module is currently in development, which will be available in both pure-python, and C-extension flavors, and you'll be able to get that via pip.
				There is also a windows '.exe' binary that you can use, available with the source code on github
				<a href="https://github.com/DavisDevelopment/GSS">here</a>.
